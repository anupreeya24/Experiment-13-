# Experiment-13-
# Constructor Overloading
# Aim:
To demonstrate the concept of function overloading in programming, showcasing how multiple functions with the same name can be defined with different parameters.

# Theory:
Function Overloading is a feature in many programming languages (like C++, Java, and Python) that allows the creation of multiple functions with the same name, provided they have different parameter lists. This increases the readability of the code and allows functions to perform similar tasks with different types or numbers of inputs.

# Key Points:

1)Same Name: Functions share the same name.

2)Different Parameters: Functions differ in type, number, or order of parameters.

3)Compile-Time Polymorphism: Overloading is resolved at compile time.
